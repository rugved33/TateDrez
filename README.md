Tatedrez Game Architecture Summary
Tatedrez sounds like an exciting project Here's an elaboration on my approach and its components:

1. MVP Architecture:
Model: Handles core game logic (e.g., rules, game state, moves).
View: Manages UI, displays the board.
Presenter: Acts as the bridge, processing input, validating moves, and updating the view.
This separation ensures modularity and testability.

2. Command Pattern for GameState:
Encapsulates each action (e.g., move, attack) as a command object.
Undo/Redo: Tracks executed commands for reversal or re-application. (TODO)

4. Factory and Dependency Injection:
Factory Pattern: Simplifies the creation of game objects (e.g., pieces, players).
Dependency Injection: Promotes loose coupling, making components (like UINavigationController) easier to test and extend.

6. Core Game Logic Testing:
Unit Tests: Validate moves, rules, and state transitions.
Edge Case Testing: Test invalid moves and game-breaking scenarios.

Benefits:
Scalability: Easy to add new features (e.g., rules, game modes).
Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns.
Testability: Robust testing ensures confidence in changes.
